# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify the Designers and Design Packages dropdown menu by removing tab navigation and replacing it with direct links.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove tab navigation interface from the Designers and Design Packages dropdown menu in the site header
- Replace tabs with simple dropdown list items that link directly to their respective pages
- Maintain consistent visual styling with other site navigation elements

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a cleaner dropdown menu under Designers and Design Packages that directly links to each page without intermediate tab selections.
